# ADR - Microservices

**Context**: The monolithic architecture of any application becomes increasingly difficult to maintain and scale as the complexity of the system grows

**Problem:**
1. Monolithic architecture may be suitable for smaller applications.
2. The application is growing and we need to split it into microservices.
3. **Local development Complexity:** It used to hang, and we had to restart the server after several code changes, which slowed progress.
4. **Deployment Complexity:** Deploying changes to a monolithic application can be complex and time-consuming. We have to wait for a long time.
5. **Service outages:** A failure in one component of the application might bring down the entire system, resulting in service outages.
6. **Hurdles in development:** Development teams might face difficulties due to codebase size and complexity. Changes or updates to one component of the application may affect other components, resulting in coordination overhead.
7. **Limited Technology Stack:** Its challenging to adopt new technologies or frameworks that may be more suited for particular components of application. Also, making it challenging to migrate to newer technologies or platforms in the future.
8. **Testing Complexity:** Testing can be complex and time-consuming. End-to-end testing is often needed to ensure that modifications do not cause unexpected consequences.
9. **Maintainability Challenges:** As applications grow in size and complexity, maintaining and extending them becomes increasingly challenging.  Codebases grow more difficult to explore, understand, and modify,leading to longer development cycles and higher maintenance costs.
10. **Scalability Challenges:**  One of the most significant disadvantages of monolithic architectures is that they can be difficult to scale and maintain because everything is tightly coupled together, it can be hard to scale individual components of the system separately.

**Considered Options:**
1. **Microservices:** We considered this approach based on prior projects.

**Discarded Options:** N/A

**Decision**: After careful consideration and evaluation of various architectural approaches, we have decided to adopt a microservices architecture for our any new application.
1. **Scalability:** Microservices architecture allows for scaling individual components independently, which enhances the scalability of the system, rather than scaling the entire monolith
2. **Faster Deployment:** Microservices provide for faster deployment of updates and modifications than monolithic systems do. Also, allowing it easier to test, deploy, and rollback changes without affecting the entire application.
3. **Flexibility:** Microservices allow teams to work on different parts of the services independently and deploy changes quickly without impacting other parts of the application.
4. **Minimal Service outages:** Failures in one microservice are less likely to impact the rest of the application. Since the application can continue to function even if some microservices have issue.
5. **Improved Maintainability:** Microservices architecture often leads to better maintainability, as each microservice is independent. This makes it easier to understand, modify, and update individual components without impacting the entire application.
6. **Technology:** Microservices allow the use of different technologies and programming languages based on the specific requirements of each microservice.

**Consequences:**
1. Handling a microservices-based architecture requires significant effort in monitoring, maintaining, and growing individual services. 
2. Effective communication between services is crucial in a microservices design.
3. We must carefully develop and implement service communication patterns to ensure reliability, performance, and consistency across the application.
4. Microservices increase complexity in architecture, Managing multiple microservices requires additional infrastructure, monitoring, and coordination, which can increase operational overhead.
